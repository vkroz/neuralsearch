# Semantic Search

Reference implementation of semantic search engine. Semantic search uses vector representation of documents and queries, and finds matching documents using vector search algorithms such as HNSW. Documents are converted to vectors using pre-trained deep learning models. This approach allows to find matching documents that have relevant meaning even when they have no lexically similar words or phrases. By capturing the semantic relationships and context within the documents, semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching and enables a more nuanced understanding of the user's intent. The vector representation allows for efficient indexing and retrieval, facilitating fast and accurate search results. Additionally, the use of pre-trained deep learning models enhances the search engine's ability to interpret and extract meaningful features from the documents. Whether it's retrieving relevant research papers, relevant news articles, or matching products in an e-commerce platform, semantic search offers an advanced and effective solution for information retrieval by leveraging the power of semantic understanding.
